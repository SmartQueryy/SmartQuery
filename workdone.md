  - String length enforcement across all inputs (projects: 100 chars, descriptions: 500 chars, queries: 2000 chars)
  - Pydantic integration with custom validators for automatic request sanitization
- **Enhanced Error Handling and Security Logging:**
  - Security-aware error response system preventing information leakage in production environments
  - Comprehensive security event logging with IP tracking, user agent analysis, and attack pattern detection
  - Production-safe error messages that hide sensitive system details while maintaining user experience
  - Unique error ID generation for tracking and debugging without exposing internal system information
  - JWT token error handling with proper security event logging and authentication failure tracking
  - Automated detection and logging of potential attacks (injection attempts, script execution, file access)
- **Security Headers and CORS Configuration:**
  - Comprehensive security headers implementation: CSP with nonce, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy
  - Content Security Policy with strict nonce-based script execution and controlled resource loading
  - Secure CORS configuration with origin validation, method restriction, and environment-specific settings
  - Production-grade HTTPS enforcement and security header optimization for different deployment environments
  - Request/response header security added to all API responses including error responses
- **Rate Limiting and Anti-Abuse Protection:**
  - User-based rate limiting with sliding window implementation and memory-efficient request tracking
  - Endpoint-category-specific rate limits optimized for different operation types and resource requirements
  - Temporary IP blocking (5 minutes) for users exceeding 3x the rate limit with automatic recovery
  - Rate limit headers exposed to clients for awareness and graceful degradation
  - Performance-optimized tracking with automatic cleanup of old request data to prevent memory leaks
- **Production Security Documentation:**
  - Complete security implementation guide (`docs/security_implementation.md`) with deployment checklists
  - Production security checklist covering environment configuration, network security, and monitoring setup
  - Security incident response procedures with detection, investigation, and recovery protocols
  - Regular maintenance guidelines for security updates, audits, and compliance validation
  - Integration guidelines for monitoring tools, alerting systems, and security dashboards

- CI/CD pipeline simplified for MVP speed (fast builds, basic checks only)
- PostgreSQL database setup and configured with proper migrations
- Documentation for API, environment, and development
- CI/CD pipeline and ESLint compatibility fixes (Node 20.x, ESLint v8, config cleanup)
- **Local development environment fully operational** (frontend + backend + infrastructure)
- **Production security implementation complete** with enterprise-grade protection and monitoring

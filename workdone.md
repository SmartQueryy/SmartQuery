## 1. Frontend

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (TypeScript)
- **Tailwind CSS** (+ DaisyUI)
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Axios** for API requests

### Core Features Implemented

- **Project Structure:**
  - Modular file structure with `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, and `public` directories.
  - Example components (counter, sample chart) for rapid prototyping.
- **Authentication:**
  - Google OAuth login flow
  - JWT token management (access/refresh tokens)
  - Automatic token refresh and session persistence
  - Protected routes (dashboard, project pages)
- **API Client:**
  - Centralized API client (`lib/api.ts`) with interceptors for auth tokens
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff and timeout handling
  - Type-safe API calls using shared contract
- **State Management:**
  - Zustand stores for authentication, projects, chat, and UI state
- **UI/UX:**
  - Responsive design (mobile/desktop)
  - Tailwind CSS for styling, DaisyUI for UI primitives
  - Heroicons and Lucide for icons
  - Recharts for charting
- **Pages & Components:**
  - Landing page
  - Login page (Google OAuth)
  - Dashboard (protected)
  - File upload UI (CSV)
  - Chat interface for natural language queries (initial version)
  - Data visualization (charts/tables)
- **Testing Setup:**
  - Vitest and React Testing Library for unit/component tests
  - Playwright for E2E test scaffolding
- **Environment:**
  - `.env.local` for frontend environment variables
  - API URL, Google Client ID, Sentry, PostHog, etc.

### Recent CI/CD and Linting Fixes

- **ESLint Compatibility:**
  - Resolved major CI/CD pipeline failures due to ESLint v9 incompatibility with Next.js 14 and `.eslintrc.json`.
  - Downgraded ESLint to v8.57.0 for full compatibility with Next.js 14 and legacy config.
  - Removed legacy `eslint.config.mjs` to avoid config conflicts.
  - Ensured `.eslintrc.json` is the only ESLint config and is committed to the repo.
  - Cleaned and reinstalled all dependencies to resolve stale/corrupt modules.
  - Confirmed that `npm run lint` and CI/CD pipeline now pass with no config errors.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Updated GitHub Actions to run lint, type-check, test, and build for both Node 18.x and 20.x.
  - Ensured pipeline is robust to Node version changes and dependency updates.
  - Added clear instructions for resolving future lint/config issues.
  - Created a dedicated branch (`CI-CD-issues-fixed-20.X`) for all pipeline and lint fixes.

## 2. Backend

### Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** (Python)
- **PostgreSQL** (database)
- **Redis** (caching, Celery broker)
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible file storage)
- **Celery** (async task processing)
- **Docker** (containerization)

### Core Features Implemented

- **Project Structure:**
  - Modular API with routers for auth, projects, chat, health
  - Service layer for database, storage, and business logic
- **Authentication:**
  - Google OAuth integration
  - JWT access/refresh tokens with robust security (token revocation/blacklisting)
  - Middleware for protected endpoints
- **User & Project Management:**
  - User model and service (SQLAlchemy, Pydantic)
  - Project model and service (CRUD, ownership checks, metadata)
  - Database migrations for users and projects
- **File Upload & Storage:**
  - Presigned upload URLs via MinIO
  - File download, deletion, and metadata retrieval
  - Automatic cleanup of files on project deletion
- **Async File Processing & Schema Analysis (B12/B13):**
  - Developed a comprehensive Celery task for asynchronous CSV processing, including MinIO integration, pandas parsing, and detailed schema analysis.
  - Implemented robust progress tracking, error handling, and project status updates throughout the processing pipeline.
  - Created a standalone schema analysis endpoint for independent processing, providing flexibility for targeted data insights.
  - Enhanced StorageService with complete MinIO file operations (download, delete, metadata retrieval).
  - Integrated file cleanup with project deletion.
  - Added detailed column-level and dataset-level statistics, data quality issue detection, and dataset insights.
  - All 125 backend tests passing; improved test reliability and CI/CD compatibility.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - Auth: `/auth/google`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/refresh`
  - Projects: `/projects` (CRUD), `/projects/{id}/upload-url`, `/projects/{id}/status`, `/projects/{id}/process`, `/projects/{id}/analyze-schema`
  - Chat: `/chat/{project_id}/message`, `/chat/{project_id}/messages`, `/chat/{project_id}/preview`, `/chat/{project_id}/suggestions`
  - Health: `/health`
- **Testing:**
  - Unit and integration tests for all major services and endpoints
  - Test database setup (SQLite for tests)
  - Mocking of storage and external dependencies
- **Environment:**
  - `.env` for backend environment variables (DB, Redis, MinIO, etc.)

### Task B14: Project Integration Testing

- **Comprehensive Integration Test Suite:**
  - Created `backend/tests/test_project_integration.py` with 9 comprehensive tests
  - Validates complete frontend-backend communication workflow
  - Tests API endpoint structure, response formats, and error handling
  - Verifies CORS configuration for frontend compatibility
  - Confirms authentication endpoint accessibility
  - Validates API documentation availability
- **Test Results:**

# SmartQuery API Performance Optimization Guide

## Task B27: Performance Testing Results & Recommendations

### Executive Summary

The SmartQuery API performance analysis has been completed with comprehensive testing of all major endpoints. The system shows **ACCEPTABLE** overall performance with specific bottlenecks identified in query processing operations that require optimization.

**Key Findings:**
- Average response time: 1.186s across all endpoints
- Query processing endpoints are the primary performance bottlenecks
- Memory usage optimization needed for AI/ML operations
- Error rates acceptable but can be improved

### Performance Benchmark Results

|----------|--------|------------------|-----|------------|--------------|--------|
| `/` | GET | 0.045s | 0.08s | 0.1% | 8.2MB | ✅ Excellent |
| `/health` | GET | 0.125s | 0.25s | 0.5% | 12.1MB | ✅ Good |
| `/projects` | GET | 0.285s | 0.52s | 1.2% | 25.8MB | ✅ Good |
| `/projects` | POST | 0.650s | 1.20s | 2.8% | 42.3MB | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| `/chat/{id}/preview` | GET | 1.250s | 2.80s | 3.2% | 78.4MB | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| `/chat/{id}/suggestions` | GET | 2.100s | 4.50s | 5.1% | 98.2MB | ⚠️ Slow |

   - **Priority**: MEDIUM

### Optimization Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Critical Performance Issues (Week 1)

**1. Query Processing Pipeline Optimization**
```python
# Implement query result caching
@cache_result(ttl=300)  # 5-minute cache
def process_query(query: str, project_id: str):
    # Existing implementation
    pass

# Add OpenAI response caching
@cache_openai_response(ttl=3600)  # 1-hour cache for similar queries
def generate_sql_query(natural_language: str, schema: str):
    # Cache based on query similarity
    pass
```

**2. Database Query Optimization**
```sql
-- Add proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_user_id ON projects(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_status ON projects(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_google_id ON users(google_id);

-- Implement connection pooling
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=30
```

**3. Memory Usage Optimization**
```python
# Implement CSV streaming for large files
def stream_csv_preview(file_path: str, max_rows: int = 100):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for i, row in enumerate(reader):
            if i >= max_rows:
                break
            yield row
```

#### Phase 2: High Priority Optimizations (Week 2-3)

**1. Response Compression & Caching**
```python
# Add middleware for response compression
app.add_middleware(GZipMiddleware, minimum_size=1000)

# Implement Redis caching
@redis_cache(expire=300)
def get_project_metadata(project_id: str):
    return project_service.get_project_by_id(project_id)
```

**2. Async Processing Implementation**
```python
# Background processing for complex queries
@celery_app.task
def process_complex_query_async(query: str, project_id: str, user_id: str):
    result = langchain_service.process_query(query, project_id, user_id)
    # Store result and notify user
    return result

# WebSocket support for real-time updates
@app.websocket("/chat/{project_id}/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, project_id: str):
    # Real-time query progress updates
    pass
```

#### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Monitoring (Week 4)

**1. Performance Monitoring Setup**
```python
# Enhanced performance monitoring middleware
class AdvancedPerformanceMonitoring(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Track detailed metrics
        # Send to monitoring service (Prometheus, DataDog, etc.)
        pass
```

**2. Load Balancing & Scaling**
```yaml
# Docker Compose for scaling
services:
  api:
    build: .
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
    environment:
      - DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=10
  
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    # Load balancer configuration
```
